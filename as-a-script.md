# As a script?

I'd love to make it so this is, instead of a project to be forked, instead a script to be run.

Here are the things it would need to do:

1. Install Jigsaw.
2. Modify the base config and set up preferred things like a staging config file, etc.
3. Import master.blade, index.blade, blog.blade, and all the other needed templates and components
4. Npm require tailwind
5. ./node_modules/.bin/tailwind init
6. Bring in the tailwind-friendly main.scss and app.scss etc.
7. Modify the default tailwind config for the design?
8. Set up the webpack config to build everythign correctly
9. ?
